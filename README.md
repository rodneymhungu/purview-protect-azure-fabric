# Purview: Protecting Data in Azure & Microsoft Fabric

## 🧭 Overview

This repo demonstrates how to **protect and govern data** across **Azure** and **Microsoft Fabric** using **Microsoft Purview**. It includes tested examples, walkthroughs, and resources designed for hands-on use.

You’ll find:

- 🧪 **Tested demos** that apply sensitivity labels to Azure data sources and visualize label metadata in Microsoft Fabric
- 🔐 **Permission guides** that outline the exact roles and licenses needed to use this functioanlity
- 🗂️ **Use case scenarios** that show how data protection applies to real-world business cases (e.g. financial document processing)

This repo is for **data security engineers/consultatants**, **compliance leads**, and **data governance professionals** looking to explore **role-aware**, **scalable**, and **practical** approaches to Purview data security deployment in Azure and Fabric.

## 🤝 Built for Real-World Collaboration

Most Microsoft Purview documentation is product-oriented. This repo focuses on the **intersection of roles** — where **data engineers**, **security architects**, **compliance teams**, and **Power BI professionals** need to align. That's where governance breaks down — and where this repo helps connect the dots.
