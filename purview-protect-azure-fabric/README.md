# Purview: Protecting Data in Azure & Microsoft Fabric

## 🧭 Overview

This repo demonstrates how to protect and govern data across Azure and Microsoft Fabric using **Microsoft Purview Information Protection**. It includes tested examples, scripts, and documentation based on real-world implementation.

With this repo, you’ll learn how to:

- 🏷️ **Classify** data in Azure SQL, Blob Storage, and other IaaS/PaaS sources using the Purview **Data Map**
- 🛡️ **Apply and enforce sensitivity labels** using both the Data Map and **Sensitive Information Types (SITs)**
- 📊 **Inherit and visualize labels** in **Microsoft Fabric** reports, enabling downstream data protection
- 🧭 **Understand the role of the Data Map and Unified Catalog** in governance and lifecycle management
- 🤝 **Coordinate across roles**: Learn how data engineers, stewards, and compliance teams work together to secure data from ingestion to insight

> This repo is ideal for practitioners working with Microsoft Purview, Azure data services, and Microsoft Fabric who want to apply **practical**, **role-aware**, and **scalable** data protection models.
