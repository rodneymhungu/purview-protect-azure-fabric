# Prerequisites 

_**Work in Progress as of 10 July 2025 - do not use until fully reviewed and tested with others! - reach out to me for comments in the meantime!**_

To test Microsoft Purview, Fabric, and Azure classification and protection features in one day, follow this checklist to ensure you have the right setup.

## ‚úÖ Core Setup Requirements

1. **Microsoft Entra ID Tenant (formerly Azure AD)**
   - You need access to a **Microsoft Entra ID tenant**, which acts as your organization‚Äôs identity and access management platform.
   - If you're part of a Microsoft partner or enterprise environment, your organization may already provide a demonstration or test tenant.
   - Otherwise, you can request an on-demand tenant depending on your role and business justification for testing Microsoft data governance services (e.g., via Microsoft Partner Center, Visual Studio subscription, or internal IT process).
   - üìò [What is Microsoft Entra ID?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis)

2. **Microsoft Azure Subscription**
   - You need an active **Azure subscription** (e.g., Pay-as-you-go, Visual Studio, or organizational).
   - This is required to create and manage resources like Azure Storage, Azure SQL, and Microsoft Purview accounts.
   - üìò [Create an Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription)


3. **Microsoft 365 E5 License**
   - You need a license that includes:
     - Microsoft Purview Information Protection
     - Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention
     - Microsoft Fabric (available via Power BI Premium or a Microsoft Fabric Trial)
   - At minimum, ensure one user has a valid **Microsoft 365 E5** or **Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance** license.
   - üìò [Compare Microsoft 365 E5 licensing options](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans)
   - üìò [Start a Microsoft Fabric trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial)


4. **Microsoft Fabric Trial or Capacity**
   - You need access to Microsoft Fabric features within the Power BI portal.
   - If you don't have Fabric enabled yet, go to [Fabric in Power BI](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) and start a trial.
   - üìò [Enable Microsoft Fabric for your organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/enable-fabric)
   - Ensure your user can create and access the following Fabric items:
     - [OneLake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/overview) ‚Äì the unified SaaS data lake for all your Fabric items
     - [Lakehouses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-overview) ‚Äì for combining structured and unstructured data
     - [Notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/notebooks-overview) ‚Äì for code-first data science and exploration
     - [Semantic Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-models/semantic-models-overview) ‚Äì for building reusable, governed data models

## üîÑ Other Setup Steps

- **Enable Microsoft Purview Governance Portal**  
  [https://web.purview.azure.com](https://web.purview.azure.com)  
  Create a new Purview account or use an existing one.

- **Enable Microsoft Purview Information Protection**  
  Go to [Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/)  
  Create or confirm sensitivity labels are active.

- **Set up sensitivity label publishing**  
  Assign a label policy to the user from the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center so they can apply labels in Microsoft Fabric or Office.

- **Configure Scan in Microsoft Purview (Governance)**  
  Scan your Azure SQL or Blob Storage using the Purview Data Map and Classification Engine.

- **Connect Fabric to a labeled Azure data source**  
  In Fabric, create a Lakehouse or semantic model using a source that was labeled by Purview. Check whether labels flow through.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Missing E5 License:** Without it, auto-labeling and protection will not work in Microsoft 365, Purview, or Fabric.
- **Label Not Published to User:** Even if labels are created, users can't apply or inherit them unless a label policy is assigned to them.
- **No Fabric Capacity Assigned:** Even with a license, you may need to explicitly enable Fabric or request access to a workspace with capacity.
- **Lack of Azure RBAC:** Without correct role assignments in Azure (e.g., Contributor on the resource group), Purview will fail to scan or label resources.
